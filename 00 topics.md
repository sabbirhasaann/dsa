The Sliding Window Technique is a powerful algorithmic approach used to solve problems involving arrays or lists where a subarray or subsequence is required to be analyzed. This technique allows you to reduce the time complexity of problems that would typically involve nested loops, by maintaining a "window" of elements and sliding it across the array. The window can either expand or shrink based on certain conditions, which helps in optimizing the solution.
